# CodeOp-Alba-Sentis-Final-Project

"A large body of work has emerged on the environmental impacts of various diets, with most studies concluding that a diet rich in plant-based foods and with fewer animal source foods confers both improved health and environmental benefits." https://eatforum.org/content/uploads/2019/07/EAT-Lancet_Commission_Summary_Report.pdf

While some governments over the world have begun adopting plant-based policies to promote a more sustainable future, achieving this on a global scale remains a significant challenge.

The objective of this project is to analyze global and regional trends in animal protein consumption since 1961, assess how dietary consumption affects CO2 emissions, determine whether variables such as population growth and GDP influence these consumption patterns and predict global trends for the next years.

Questions
What are the global and regional trends in animal protein consumption since 1961?
How does protein consumption choices impact CO2 emissions?
Do factors such as population growth and GDP influence a country's animal protein consumption and CO2 emissions?
Can we forecast CO2 emissions derived from animal protein consumption?
Data
Final dataframe was accomplished by integrating four distinct datasets sourced from different data sources. These are:
