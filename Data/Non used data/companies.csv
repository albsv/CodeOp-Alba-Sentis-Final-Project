Freshwoof (Urban Tails Private Limited),"India-based company producing sustainable, 100% plant-based dog food.Freshwoof is Asia’s first fresh vegan dog food that is healthier for dogs and better for the planet. We at Freshwoof believe that every dog deserves the best life possible and a pet’s food and nutrition is the foundation of their health and future but unfortunately the majority of the pet foods on the market are filled with harmful preservatives, chemicals, by-products, or artificial colors and flavors. All these ingredients are causing serious health issues like cancer and organ failure in our pets. Also, to escape from these nasty ingredients some pet parents are feeding their pets homemade diets that are most of the time nutritionally unbalanced and can cause nutritional deficiencies or excess of certain nutrients in the dog's body. Moreover, the pet food industry is highly dependent on meat as the only protein source for dogs, despite the fact that dogs are omnivorous just like us and can thrive on a well-formulated plant-based or meat-free diet, various studies have proved it already! The premium meat in pet food is fuelling the climate crisis. We know producing pet food creates more than 64 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year and every day more of our precious rainforests are being destroyed to cultivate meat. It takes more energy and resources to create meat-based dog food and results in more waste than vegan dog food. Our planet is not left with enough resources to cater to both humans and our pets, with the current food system we cannot fulfill the demands of future generations. Therefore, to solve all these problems we have introduced Freshwoof. Freshwoof is a plant-powered solution that helps dog parents feed their dogs healthy food, sustainably and ethically. Freshwoof superfood is made with 100% vegan and human-grade ingredients without harmful preservatives, chemicals, or artificial colors and flavors. We have three different recipes that are complete and balanced i.e contains all the essential nutrients a dog needs to be healthy and hearty, and also contain a proprietary blend of organic ayurvedic herbs to provide additional health benefits to dogs. Along with being a healthier option for dogs, Freshwoof is a way better option for the planet. Freshwoof consumes way fewer resources as compared to traditional meat-based dog food.
